# Steam Family Sharing Bypass

**DISCLAIMER:** I have no idea if this works anymore due to Steam's family sharing system udpating. 

## Info
The use of this program is to allow you to play another family member's game from their Steam library, as they are using their own library. 
This utilizes firewall rules on windows to block Steam from accessing the internet, therefore not being able to detect if the library is in use and letting you launch the game without any issues.
